# StarshipScript
Starship Script to install starship with configuration files on a linux distro.


A standard script that will transform your original terminal into a new terminal with some nice icons. 

You must be logged in as a root user. 
First you must clone the repo and then execute the install.sh file. 
This script will update and upgrade your OS. 
If you want to install the nerd font I use (ComicShannsMono) you can do it easily with the script, you will have a prompt asking if you want to.
Then ZSH will be used as the default terminal and starship will be installed and configured. I invite you to check the script by yourself to understand any further. 

The starship website can be found here : https://starship.rs if you want to add any other modules to your configuration file. 
The Nerd Fonts website can be found here : https://www.nerdfonts.com/ if you want to change the font you want to install you can edit the script. 

The script will ask you if you want to reboot your system now or later. I recommend you to reboot as soon as possible.  

Here is an overview of what your terminal will look like.
