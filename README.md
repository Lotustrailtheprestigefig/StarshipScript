# StarshipScript
Starship Script to install starship with configuration files on a linux distro.


A standard shell script that will transform your original terminal into a new terminal with some nice icons. 

You must be logged in as a root user. 
First you must clone the repo and then execute the install.sh file. 
This script will update and upgrade your operating system. 
If you want to install the nerd font I use (ComicShannsMono) you can do it easily with the script, you will have a prompt asking if you want to.
Then ZSH will be used as the default terminal and starship will be installed and configured. I invite you to check the script by yourself to understand any further. 

The starship website can be found here : https://starship.rs if you want to add any other modules to your configuration file. 
The Nerd Fonts website can be found here : https://www.nerdfonts.com/ if you want to change the font you want to install you can edit the script. 

The script will ask you if you want to reboot your system now or later. I recommend you to reboot as soon as possible.
