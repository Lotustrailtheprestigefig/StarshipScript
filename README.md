# StarshipScript
Shell Script to install starship with configuration files on a linux distro.


A standard shell script that will transform your original terminal into a new terminal with some nice icons. 

First you must clone the repo and then execute the install.sh file. 
This script will update and upgrade your operating system. 
Then ZSH will be used as the default terminal and starship will be installed and configured. I invite you to check the script by yourself to understand any further. 

The starship website can be found here : https://starship.rs if you want to add any other modules to your configuration file. 

The script will ask you if you want to reboot your system now or later. I recommend you to reboot as soon as possible.
