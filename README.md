# StarshipScript
Shell Script to install starship with configuration files on a linux distro.


A standard shell script that will transform your original terminal into a new terminal with some nice icons. 

This script will update and upgrade your operating system. The ComicShannsMono nerd font will be installed (you can change it in the script if you want to) the original website of nerd fonts can be foud here : https://www.nerdfonts.com/. Then ZSH will be used as the default terminal and starship will be installed and configured. I invite you to check the script by yourself to understand any further. 

The starship website can be found here : https://starship.rs if you want to add any other modules to your configuration file.
